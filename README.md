# Extended-BP-Framework
This paper provides guidance on using a tool for optimizing S-box circuits while preserving nonlinear gates and AND-depth.

## Options of main.py
**-h** : Show the help message and exit.  
**search** : Search for optimized circuits. (default)  
**analyze** : Generates files by analyzing the result and log files.  

##### Search Options
**-f** : Specifies the circuit filename to optimize (excluding the **.py** extension). [default : **AES10**]  
**-m** : Indicates the number of cores for multi-threading. Each core runs independently to optimize the target circuit. If set to 1, a single core is used. [default : 1]  
**-a** : Selects the BP-based algorithm to apply (**RNBP** or **BPD**). [default : **RNBP**]  
**-d** or **-H** : Sets the depth limit. [default : 23]  
**-r** : Enable or disables random circuit modification mode (```True``` or ```False```). [default : ```False```]  

## Usage Examples
This section provides example commands along with explanations of their outcomes.

>python main.py search

This command performs the optimization process for the circuit specified in 
**code_target_imps/AES10.py**, utilizing eRNBP.

>python main.py -f AES12

The optimization process targets the circuit in **code_target_imps/AES12.py**, utilizing eRNBP.

>python main.py -f AES12 -m 12 -a BPD -H 15

Here, the optimization focuses on the circuit in **code_target_imps/AES12.py**, using eBPD with 12 cores and a depth limit of 15.

>python main.py -f Ascon

In this case, the circuit in **code_target_imps/Ascon.py** is optimized with eRNBP.

>python main.py -f Ascon -m 4 -a BPD -H 5 -r True

This command applies optimization to the circuit in **code_target_imps/Ascon.py** using eBPD with 4 cores, a depth limit of 5, and random circuit modification mode enabled.

>python main.py -f Saturnin -m 8 -a RNBP

The optimization is applied to the circuit in **code_target_imps/Saturnin.py**, utilizing eRNBP on 8 cores.

>python main.py analyze

The analysis processes all results stored in the **code_results** directory, generating a summary in **code_results/CODE_RESULTS.txt**. Log files in the **log** directory are reviewed, with changes in Dist saved to **log/view_Dist** and additional information stored in **log/view_all_Info**.

Files in **code_results** directory : Results included in the paper.  

## How to Upload Circuits
To optimize a circuit, it must be uploaded as a Python file in the **code_target_imps** directory.
The implementation of the circuit must be inserted at the position marked by the following comment in the file:

```################### Here is your code !! ###################```

The input and output variables must be listed as ```x``` and ```y```, respectively.
For further instructions, refer to the example file provided in the **code_target_imps** directory.

## Generated Files by Our Tool
The **code_results** directory includes the result **.py** files.  
The **code_formal** directory includes temporary **.py** files to extract XOR information.  
The **log** directory includes log files recording the optimization process.  
The **log/view_Dist** directory includes log files that record changes to *Dist*.  
The **log/view_all_Info** directory includes log files containing information other than *Dist*.  

## Notes on Analyzing the Results
Using the **analyze** option, in **code_results/CODE_RESULTS.txt**, the following metrics are analyzed: depth (with NOTs), depth (without NOTs), AND-depth, ANDs, ORs, XORs, and NOTs.
When all NOT gates are combined into an XNOR gate, the latency of the circuit follows *depth (without NOTs)* rather than *depth (with NOTs)*.

## Running Time
Our multi-threading option does not improve the speed of one search, but it enables multiple searches to run concurrently. The time taken for one search for each circuit is as follows:  
Ascon S-box : Less than 1s  
AES S-box : 3h - 20h  
A part of SNOW3G S-box : 12h - a day  
Saturnin super S-box : About a week
